php
Copy
Edit
<?php
$host = "sqlXXX.infinityfree.com";  // Replace with your actual host
$user = "if0_12345678";             // Your DB username
$pass = "your_db_password";         // Your DB password
$db   = "if0_12345678_blood_donation"; // Your full DB name

$conn = new mysqli($host, $user, $pass, $db);
if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}
?>
üî∏ 7. Visit Your Website
